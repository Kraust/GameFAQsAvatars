previous (posted as is from the old changelog)

2.0.4: Fixed an issue with interaction with Gameweasel (Chrome).

2.0.0: Added File Uploader. Note this interacts with an external PHP page, 
and is a -bit- laggy. It works tho. I also created a dropbox account just
for this plugin, because prior I was using my own (personal) one. Also I 
fixed the annoying bug with Polls. If you don't know what I'm talking about. Good.

1.5.5: (I didn't actually change anything, but the changelog was out of date
+ I'm rebranding this as GameFAQs-Avatars.

1.5.2: Changed defaults around to make the plugin less apparent on other
boards. (Although it does work on other boards...)

1.5.1: Fixed a small bug with the cookie.

1.5: Huge Update that incorporates the ability to toggle between left avatars, 
right avatars and no avatars from a button located at the top of the message view.

1.4.7: New way of displaying the images. Images are now on the right margin of 
the page instead of the left. This means however that I ave slightly changed how cite tags are interpreted.

1.4.6: Fixed an issue where Chrome was displaying unneeded white space in cases 
where there wasn't an avatar to display. (used .remove() instead).
